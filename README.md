This blog post demonstrates how to - 

Download a data set                                    <br>
Train a Random Forest model in R  <br>
Export the model to a PMML file                    <br>
Load the PMML file in Ruby with Scoruby  <br>
Send features to the loaded model and score 

## About  
Web User Interface that loads the blog post's Random Forest PMML file   <br>
Provides a web UI to send features and receive scores. <br>
The technology stack for this project is built entirely on Ruby with Rails and Scoruby<br>
## Usage

Fork this repo and specify PMML files for your own models.         
For now you need to adjust the form for your models.          
Next version form will adjust itself to loaded models

Web User Interface design                                                     <br>
Load PMML files                                                   <br>
UI will adjust by models.                                         <br>
Support more models                                               <br>
